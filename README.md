# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Classification
This project classifies brain tumors from MRI images using a Custom CNN and a Transfer Learning model (MobileNetV2). Both models were trained, evaluated, and compared using accuracy and confusion matrices. A Streamlit web app was developed to allow users to upload MRI images and receive real-time predictions.
